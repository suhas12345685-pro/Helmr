## 2025-05-25 - Missing index on jobs table for priority ordering
**Learning:** The jobs table in SQLite misses an index for `ORDER BY priority DESC, created_at ASC`, which is frequently used in `listJobs` and `claimNextJob`. While SQLite can use temporary B-trees, adding `idx_jobs_priority_created` directly avoids this sorting step, reducing CPU and improving claim/list latency.
**Action:** Add an index on `jobs(priority DESC, created_at ASC)` to SQLite memory store schema.

## 2025-05-27 - Sequential File Reading Bottleneck in SkillRegistry
**Learning:** In `SkillRegistry.list()`, reading skill files from disk one by one using a sequential `for...of` loop can block the event loop and introduce a measurable I/O bottleneck when parsing numerous files.
**Action:** Use `Promise.all` with `Array.map` to parallelize file reading and parsing operations whenever dealing with independent file I/O operations in loops, preserving the output order.
