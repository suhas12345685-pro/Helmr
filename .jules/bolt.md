## 2025-05-25 - Missing index on jobs table for priority ordering
**Learning:** The jobs table in SQLite misses an index for `ORDER BY priority DESC, created_at ASC`, which is frequently used in `listJobs` and `claimNextJob`. While SQLite can use temporary B-trees, adding `idx_jobs_priority_created` directly avoids this sorting step, reducing CPU and improving claim/list latency.
**Action:** Add an index on `jobs(priority DESC, created_at ASC)` to SQLite memory store schema.

## 2025-05-27 - Sequential File Reading Bottleneck in SkillRegistry
**Learning:** In `SkillRegistry.list()`, reading skill files from disk one by one using a sequential `for...of` loop can block the event loop and introduce a measurable I/O bottleneck when parsing numerous files.
**Action:** Use `Promise.all` with `Array.map` to parallelize file reading and parsing operations whenever dealing with independent file I/O operations in loops, preserving the output order.
## 2025-06-03 - SkillRegistry `get` bottleneck
**Learning:** `SkillRegistry.get()` was using `list()` which read and parsed the entire skills directory instead of constructing the explicit path using `fileFor(id)` to read just the requested skill. In stateless scenarios checking individual skills often, this produces O(n) file lookups.
**Action:** When working with stateless file-backed persistence abstractions, ensure single-item fetch methods target files explicitly rather than relying on list-and-filter.
## 2026-06-03 - Optimize self-healing probe detect method
**Learning:** Sequential `await` calls on independent async operations (like database queries) create unnecessary latency. In `packages/scheduler/src/self-healing.ts`, the `detect` method was sequentially querying jobs for each `ACTIVE_STATUSES` and then for `failed` jobs.
**Action:** Replace sequential loops of async operations with `Promise.all` to fetch data concurrently when the operations are independent, and use a test bench to quantify the performance gain.
## 2025-02-13 - Missing indices on SQLite foreign keys causing O(N) table scans
**Learning:** SQLite does not automatically index foreign keys. Tables with heavily queried foreign key relations (e.g., heavily looped Promise.all calls in Node.js fetching relational rows) can perform very poorly via O(N) full table scans if indices are not explicitly created alongside the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint.
**Action:** Always explicitly pair `FOREIGN KEY` definitions with `CREATE INDEX` statements in SQLite schema definitions to prevent O(N) full table scans, especially for tables queried frequently by their foreign key columns.
